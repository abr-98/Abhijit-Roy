- Drowsiness Detector:
  - Python based project on image processing to fire an alarm if it detects the driver sleeping by chance,it is a part of the idea to build a automated automobile module
 
- Voice Controlled Security Systems:
  - Python project based on image processing, face detection and comparison algorihms 
  - The project is aimed to create an advanced voice controlled security door lock system which will operate on face unlock.

- Stock Price Prediction Algorithm (Currently running):
  - A attempt to predict the stock market price for a particular stock based on several factors that may affect the price
  - This project attempts to consider past performances of the company and the condition of the other companies at that time and others.

- A real time scrapper chatbot (Currently running):
  - A chatbot with realtime webscrapping facilities.

## My Dreams:

In the present world, Machine learning is getting immensely popular due to its capabilities of achieving success in solving problems, that has brought huge changes to the lives of common people. Currently, if we look closely, many of the services that we come across in our lives actually implement machine learning algorithms. It has found its application in several fields, from defense to medical. Some of the best and interesting applications for me are autonomous driving cars and human action and emotion detections. One of my dreams have been to work on these projects. I have had the opportunity to be a part of computer vision projects dedicated towards medical field. Computer vision  has great capabilities and if we can apply them in these fields we can achieve great hieghts of success. The machine learing field has a lot of applications to list them down, I have mentioned a few which are very interesting to me.

To sum everything up, this field has never failed to surprise me, though I have not been here for long. Scientists and researchers have already achieved huge results in the current time and are working towards achieving more robust appications. I dream to work with the community to develop something which will serve the human community.
