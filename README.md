## Projects:

### Academic:

- Road Profiling:
  -  C++ project based on real time data with the objective to classify the type of road and classify bumps and pot-holes using defined function for linear regression 

- Speed-sensor:
  - Python project based on application of Machine Learning and Artificial Neural Networks to find the safe speed on a road with some real time data and to rate a driver in real time comparing the driving speed with the optimal obtained speed flask appliction to host model
 
- Bus-Stop-Finder:
  - Python Project based on Machine Learning and application of artificial neural networks to detect the presence of a bus-stop at a particular point based on real data and prediction of future bus stop points analyzing the results obtained from the model.

- Bio-Medical Image Segmentation:
  - Convolutional neural networks based project for Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Segmentation and White matter segmentation based on Python.

- COVID-19 Effects on the Internet:
  - Due to the effects of Work From Home culture there has been a lot of effect on the internet due to huge traffic. This project aims to study the changes and develop some modification.

### Personal:

- Cam-Security:
  - Python Project based on Image Processing using webcams to let computers look after themselves in user-absence

- Stock-app:
  - Project deploying Python,PHP,CSS,HTML5,XAMPP,Javascript,MYSQL to upload automated Real Time Trade Details File and host them on a site on personal user portals as Databases with Record
 
-Drowsiness Detector:
  - Python based project on image processing to fire an alarm if it detects the driver sleeping by chance,it is a part of the idea to build a automated automobile module
